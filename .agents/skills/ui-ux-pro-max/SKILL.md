# ui-ux-pro-max

AI-powered design intelligence with 84 UI styles, 192 color palettes, 74 font pairings, 98 UX guidelines, and 25 chart types across 22 tech stacks. Searchable database with priority-based recommendations.

# Prerequisites

The bundled scripts require Python 3 (standard library only — no third-party packages, no network access). Check if it is available:

```bash
python3 --version || python --version
```

If Python is not installed, **do not install it yourself**. Stop and ask the user to install Python 3 using their preferred method (e.g. from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or their OS package manager), then continue once it is available. Never run package-manager or system-modifying commands (`sudo`, `brew`, `apt`, `winget`, etc.) on the user's machine for this skill.

If the user prefers not to install Python, skip the CLI searches and rely on the Quick Reference sections above.

> **Note:** On Windows, use `python` instead of `python3` to run scripts (e.g., `python scripts/search.py` instead of `python3 scripts/search.py`).

## How to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user requests any of the following:

| Scenario | Trigger Examples | Start From |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **New project / page** | "做一个 landing page"、"Build a dashboard" | Step 1 → Step 2 (design system) |
| **New component** | "Create a pricing card"、"Add a modal" | Step 3 (domain search: style, ux) |
| **Choose style / color / font** | "What style fits a fintech app?"、"推荐配色" | Step 2 (design system) |
| **Review existing UI** | "Review this page for UX issues"、"检查无障碍" | Quick Reference checklist above |
| **Fix a UI bug** | "Button hover is broken"、"Layout shifts on load" | Quick Reference → relevant section |
| **Improve / optimize** | "Make this faster"、"Improve mobile experience" | Step 3 (domain search: ux, react) |
| **Implement dark mode** | "Add dark mode support" | Step 3 (domain: style "dark mode") |
| **Add charts / data viz** | "Add an analytics dashboard chart" | Step 3 (domain: chart) |
| **Stack best practices** | "React performance tips"、"SwiftUI navigation" | Step 4 (stack search) |

Follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:
- **Product type**: Entertainment (social, video, music, gaming), Tool (scanner, editor, converter), Productivity (task manager, notes, calendar), or hybrid
- **Target audience**: C-end consumer users; consider age group, usage context (commute, leisure, work)
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: whatever the user is actually building with — infer it from the project
  (package.json, existing files, explicit request) or ask. Then load its rules with
  `--stack <name>` (see "Available Stacks"). Do not assume React Native.
- **Platform**: web or native app. Several sections below are scoped to App UI
  (iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter) and do not apply to desktop-web work —
  safe areas, haptics, bottom nav and Dynamic Type are mobile-only concerns.

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED)

**Always start with `--design-system`** to get comprehensive recommendations with reasoning:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This command:
1. Searches domains in parallel (product, style, color, landing, typography)
2. Applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv` to select best matches
3. Returns complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, effects
4. Includes anti-patterns to avoid

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

After getting the design system, use domain searches to get additional details:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

Get implementation-specific best practices for the user's stack:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack <stack>
```
